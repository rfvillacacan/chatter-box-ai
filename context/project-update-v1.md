want this system to behave like a discovery engine, not a “fact-checker”:

It should generate new theories, models, and explanations – even if they are speculative.

It should use logic, analytics, common sense, correlations, and pattern-matching to push beyond what is already known.

You don’t care if the result is:

unproven,

unconventional,

or goes beyond mainstream consensus,
as long as it is coherent and reasoned.

You want AI + human to explore “most probable” or “interesting” explanations, not to be blocked or shut down just because evidence is incomplete.

The only unavoidable limitation (from my side) is:

I must still:

label speculation as speculation,

not present conjecture as proven fact,

and avoid harmful / dangerous content.

But inside those bounds, we can push as far as you want into:

alternative models,

hypothetical mechanisms,

correlations and “what if” architectures.

So for your app:

Theorist: can propose bold, creative hypotheses and alternative histories / models.

Critic: tests for internal consistency and obvious nonsense, but does not censor – it refines and sharpens.

Researcher: brings in evidence where possible, but if evidence is missing, it still allows the hypothesis to stand as “speculative”.

Formalizer: turns these into structured models, equations, and testable predictions, even if they are “just a theory” for now.

Instead of “Is this allowed or not?”, the core question becomes:

“Given what we know and can infer, what plausible models can we build, how do they work, and what would we test next?”
